# Sushi Restaurant Demo

This project is one of the Main JavaScript curriculum projects at [Microverse](https://https://www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc

The [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page) belongs to the [javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript) module from [The Odin Project page](https://www.theodinproject.com/home). The objective is to practice DOM manipulation dynamically rendering a simple restaurant demo page. Almost all of the HTML was generated just by manipulating the DOM.
